//! The content packs: the files the engine and the game run on (circuits,
//! bikes, models, textures, music, fonts and art), each asked for by its
//! path in its pack, `textures/grass.jpg`, and none built into the code.
//!
//! There are two packs, laid one over the other: the engine's own
//! ([`ENGINE`], the engine crate's `assets/`: its demo circuit and bikes, the
//! textures, the font, the gamepads' art) and the game's, which it
//! registers as it starts ([`register_pack`], `assets/`: its circuits,
//! bikes, models, music and art). A file is read from the first pack that
//! lists it, the game's before the engine's: the game's `circuits/bahia.ron`
//! (with its song) in place of the engine's (with none), its `game.ron` in
//! place of the engine's.
//!
//! Where a pack's files are read from depends on the build:
//!
//! - **A desktop development build** (`cargo run`, `cargo test`) reads them
//!   from the disk, from the pack's folder, so a file can be changed with
//!   no compiling (and none is built in, which keeps such builds quicker to
//!   link). It still reads none its pack's `pack.txt` leaves out, so it
//!   fails where a release would.
//! - **A release build, and every web build**, has them built into the
//!   executable: the files each pack's `pack.txt` lists are embedded by
//!   `build.rs` and served from memory, so the game stays a single file.
//!
//! Two ways to have one:
//!
//! - [`file()`] and [`text`], at once, for what is needed as the game starts
//!   (the circuits and the roster, the textures, the models, the fonts);
//! - through Bevy's asset server, from the asset source [`SOURCE`]
//!   (`content://music/bahia.mp3`, see [`path`]), loaded in the background,
//!   for what can come a little later (the songs, as they start playing).
//!
//! Steps 3 and 4d of the engine's split from the game (`ROADMAP.md`).
