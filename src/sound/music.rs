//! Music: each track has its own song ([`crate::circuits::Song`]), which
//! loops for the whole race. Every song is turned up or down so that they
//! all sound as loud over the engines: to the same loudness, [`LOUDNESS`],
//! above 500 Hz, where the engines' drone does not cover it. Below that,
//! songs with heavy bass carry more, and a song measured over all of it
//! would be heard less. It plays well below the engines, so the bike (revs,
//! gear changes, tyres, impacts) is always heard over it: its loudest second
//! at least 10 dB under the player's engine flat out.
//!
//! The menus (the welcome screen, the lobby, the modes and the tracks) have
//! a song of their own, [`MENU`], low; choosing the bike has none: the
//! sounds of the track's surroundings ([`super::ambience`]) instead.
//!
//! In free ride, Y (on a gamepad, the top face button) changes what plays
//! ([`FreeMusic`]): the track's song, the songs of every track one after
//! another from this one's, or three chill songs ([`CHILL`]), a little
//! quieter ([`CHILL_LOUDNESS`]).
//!
//! It fades in when the race starts and out when leaving it, drops in the
//! pause menu, and M mutes it with everything else.
