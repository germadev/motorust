//! in at its apex and out wide again after it, straight through gentle
//! bends. Found by easing each point towards where the neighbours either
//! side of it, and theirs beyond, would have it to bend least (the fairing
//! of a curve: (-P₋₂ + 4 P₋₁ + 4 P₁ - P₂) / 6), a long reach first (the

//! within the asphalt at every step. (Easing towards the middle of the
//! neighbours alone would give the shortest way round instead, hugging
//! the inside from well before the corner.)
