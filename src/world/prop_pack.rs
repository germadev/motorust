//! Props made elsewhere (with Meshy), in packs (`tools/import_props.py`
//! prepares them): each pack's meshes by name and one material in the
//! colours of all of them ([`PropPack`]), loaded as the game starts for the
//! themes that name them ([`PropPacks`]); and how a prop is placed: where
//! it stands and which way it faces ([`spot`]), the ground kept clear so
//! that a landmark is in view from the road ([`in_view`]), and the parts
//! that turn ([`Turning`]). The engine's: the themes of a game place their
//! own props with it (feudal Japan's, Middle-earth's, the toy store's).
