//! How much detail the world is drawn with. The sun's shadows have a
//! [`Level`], chosen in Options > Graphics or, automatically, lowered while
//! the frame rate falls short of its target and raised again once it keeps
//! up ([`AutoQuality`]): how far they reach, in how many cascades and how
//! fine. They fade out at the end of their reach (see [`super::shadow_fade`]),
//! so a change of level shows as little as a shadow coming near. Nothing
//! else changes with the level, so nothing pops in or out as it does. The
//! edges are smoothed as Options > Graphics says: changing it makes every
//! pipeline again, and what they draw vanishes meanwhile, so only the
//! performance forced changes it by itself (below), and seldom.
//!
//! With two players the world is drawn twice a frame, once for each half of
//! the screen, each with its own shadows, so (unless Options > Graphics says
//! otherwise) it is drawn lighter: the shadows at the lowest level, the
//! grass, flowers and petals nearer and the trees lighter sooner.
//!
//! The performance forced (Options > Graphics > "Force performance") goes
//! further down the same way, quicker, to keep 60 or 120 frames a second
//! (no more than the frame rate cap or the screen let through): the
//! parallax first, if chosen (the dearest of the relief, on the most
//! pixels, the grass, and the least seen in a race: the normal maps stay),
//! then the shadows and the share of the window's resolution the world is
//! drawn at (see [`crate::render_scale`]) by turns, down a ladder of
//! [`Rung`]s ([`ladder`]), and on the way, if chosen, the multisampling,
//! FXAA instead. None but the multisampling makes a pipeline again, so
//! only it stutters: for a moment, as it goes and as it comes back.
