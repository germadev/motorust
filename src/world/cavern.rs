//! A mine's excavation (see [`super::scenery::Mine`]): galleries and halls
//! hewn through the rock, with high, rough roofs, pillars of rock left
//! between the roads where a branch takes another way through (see
//! [`crate::track::Fork`]), and stone of several kinds along it (see
//! [`Stone`]), lit by lanterns.
//!
//! The rock is worked out on a grid over the ground. Inside is the space
//! between the walls of the roads, the ones the bikes run into (see
//! [`Track::edge_beside`]), along the stretch of the lap the excavation
//! takes and the branches that stand in for it. Its walls stand straight up
//! from the edge of that space to above a rider's head and lean out a
//! little higher; from their tops the roof rises in a rough arch to the
//! crown of each hall, highest over the middle of each road, with
//! stalactites hanging from it. Where two roads part, the roofs over them
//! come down to the rock left between them. Over all of it lies the outside
//! of the rock: the top of the mesa it is cut into, and its faces round the
//! two mouths, framed with timber.
//!
//! The halls of Moria are dug alike (see [`super::scenery::MiddleEarth`]),
//! but some of dwarves' masonry and some natural caves, and wider than the
//! road: it runs through them between low walls of their stone, under
//! roofs far above (see [`Hall::width`]), past rows of great pillars.
