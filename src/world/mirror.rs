//! Water that mirrors what stands round it (`mirror.wgsl`): still and dark,
//! the hills, the roads, the dams and the sky in it, more the lower one
//! looks across it, stirred by a faint ripple near the camera, as a
//! reservoir's. A dam's lake is drawn so (see [`super::dam`]), and so is
//! the sea, unless Options > Graphics > Water says otherwise (or the track
//! is Loop Island, whose sea is always the cartoon one, see
//! [`super::sea`]).
//!
//! What the water mirrors is mapped from above with the rest of the circuit,
//! away from the main thread ([`prepare_mirror`]): at each point, the colour
//! of what stands there, lit, and how high it stands over the water; and the
//! sky's gradient each way. The shader follows the reflected line of sight
//! over that map until it meets something, or else takes the sky's colour
//! that way. What stands on the ground (buildings, torii, the trees in
//! colour) has maps of its own, given as it is put in the world, and shows
//! in the water faintly, broken up ([`PreparedMirror::stand_up`]).
