//! Fields of flowers (see [`FlowerField`]), as on the hills of Tsushima and
//! round the lakes at the foot of Mount Fuji: red spider lilies, white
//! flowers, yellow rape blossom, irises, the silvery gold plumes of susuki
//! and carpets of moss phlox.
//!
//! Where the fields are, and of what, is a map ([`FlowerMap`]) the terrain
//! is drawn with: its grass in flower is drawn apart, with a texture of
//! the lawn covered in blossoms (see [`super::foliage::meadow`]), so a
//! field is a carpet of colour from near and from afar at no cost but a
//! texture. Near the roads, clumps of the flowers stand up out of it (but
//! for the phlox, which hugs the ground): two cards standing crossed and one
//! lying over them, cut out of one atlas painted at startup (see
//! [`super::foliage::flowers`]), gathered into a mesh for each square of
//! ground, drawn only near the camera and casting no shadows, as they are
//! many and see-through.
