//!   curbs) to the walls, the colour of the grass they grow in, so the
//!   ground beside the road has some depth as it rushes past;
//! - along the edge of the asphalt, a strip of grass lying over it with a
//!   ragged edge (see [`super::foliage::grass_edge`]), so the road does not

//!
//! They are gathered into meshes for every stretch of each road, so the

//! camera, where they can be made out, and cast no shadows: they are many,
//! and see-through, which is dear to draw.
