//! Terreno alrededor del circuito, inspirado en Speed Bay (Moto Racer): junto a la
//! carretera sigue su altura y su peralte; más allá hay colinas de hierba,
//! peñascos que caen a pico sobre los muros, playas y el mar al oeste y al

//!
//! Se calcula una vez al arrancar sobre una rejilla: fina cerca del circuito
