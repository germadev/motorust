//! The keyboard's curves: with Options > Control > Advanced's keyboard
//! behaviour on Bézier, the keyboard and the d-pad lean the bike over and the lean
//! turns it, each step shaped by a Bézier curve (see [`crate::bezier`]):
//!
//! - **A, leaning in**: how far over the rider is for how long the key has
//!   been held, and how long that takes.
//! - **B, standing up**: how far back up for how long it has been let go.
//! - **C, unwinding**: turning the other way, how the lean comes back to
//!   upright first (at once, as always, or over a time).
//! - **D, the lean at speed**: how far over the bike goes at most for how
//!   fast it goes, down to a share at top speed.
//! - **E, the turn for the lean**: how much the bike turns for how far
//!   over it is.
//!
//! Each curve's shape is chosen (see [`CurveShape`]): the classic one (the
//! keyboard as it is without the curves, the default), CSS's easings, its
//! own four numbers, or the one the game learns from how the player rides.
//! The lean shown is the one the curves give (see [`super::step`]), so
//! what is seen is what turns the bike.
