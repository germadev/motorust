//! Cubic Bézier easing curves, as CSS's `cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)`:
//! from (0, 0) to (1, 1), shaped by two control points in between. With
//! both control points' x between 0 and 1 the curve never turns back on
//! itself across, so each x has one y: a function, which is what the
//! keyboard's curves need (see [`crate::bike::curves`]).
