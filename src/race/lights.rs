//! The start lights, as in a Grand Prix: a moment after the grid is set
//! up, five red lights (or as many as the options say) come on one by one,
//! a second apart, and a moment after the last one (never quite the same,
//! or, as the options say, a second, on their beat) they go out and the
//! race starts. Until then every bike waits on the grid, though the players can
//! rev their engines ([`Race::held`]). Each light beeps as it comes on, and
//! going out beeps higher, while the lights flash green.
//!
//! In the options ([`crate::settings::RaceStart`]) the lights can also leave the bikes free
//! on the grid (once the first light is on): a player who moves off before
//! they go out jumps the start. The first false starts of each player (two
//! at first: [`crate::settings::Settings::false_starts`]) send everybody
//! back to the grid and the lights start again; the next one disqualifies. Or the race can start as it used to, when a player
//! first opens the throttle, with no lights.
