//! The circuits read again when their files change on the disk, in a
//! desktop development build: a circuit saved in an editor is seen in the
//! game a moment later, with no restart. (Step 3 of the engine's split,
//! `ROADMAP.md`, for the map editor to come.)
//!
//! Twice a second [`watch`] asks the disk when the circuits' list and each
//! circuit's file were last changed. When one was, it reads them all again
//! and tells the world which circuits are new ([`CircuitsReloaded`]): the
//! world forgets what it had built of them and builds the one chosen again
//! (see [`crate::world`]). A file with a mistake is told in the log, and
//! the game goes on with what it had. Not in a race: what changed waits
//! till it is over.
