//! The speedometer of the race, bottom right, after the user's SVG design
//! (its measures and colours are the constants below): a see-through dial
//! that darkens towards its rim (from clear in the middle to translucent
//! black), the speeds from 0 to 360 km/h round it (from 180 a little bigger
//! each, and from 300 red, over a red arc), a blue pointer, and the speed in
//! figures on a translucent dark disc in the middle. The pointer glows, and
//! the figure of the scale it points at lights up, with no halo: blue, or
//! bright red from the red line up.
//!
//! Bevy does not draw SVG, so the shapes of the design are drawn with zeno
//! (the rasterizer Bevy already uses for the fonts, which reads SVG path
//! data) and its figures with the UI font, once per size, at the exact size
//! the dial takes on the screen. The pointer is another image the size of
//! the dial, turned with the node's [`UiTransform`]. The figures of the
//! scale lit up are drawn once each, on their own small images over the
//! dial, shown as much as each one is lit. Each frame, only the pointer's
//! angle, how lit each figure is and the figures in the middle change.
