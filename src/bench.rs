//! The benchmark (`make bench`, or the game started with `--bench` or
//! `MOTORUST_BENCH=1`): with no one at the controls, it rides every track
//! (or those in `MOTORUST_BENCH_TRACKS`, as `0,2`) in free ride on
//! autopilot, all round the lap with one player and then with two, trying
//! each setting worth comparing (the shadows' levels, the ground left out of
//! them, the ways of smoothing the edges, the lighter far trees, the relief
//! of the textures, less detail for two players), with the frame rate
//! unlimited.
//!
//! All round the lap the settings take turns of a couple of seconds (let
//! settle half a second, then measured), each round in a different order,
//! so that every one of them is measured all over the track, on the same
//! roads as the rest; it rides on until it has gone all round and each
//! setting has been measured for `MOTORUST_BENCH_SECONDS` (10 by default).
//! Each lap begins with every setting tried once, unmeasured, while its
//! shaders compile. The game's share of the CPU is read over each turn, and
//! where on the lap the frames came slowest and fastest is noted.
//!
//! It says what it is doing in the terminal as it goes, and on the screen
//! under the frame rate: the setting on, and how far round the lap. The
//! results are written as they are measured to `bench-results/` (in the
//! folder it is run from: the repository, with `make bench`), one file for
//! each run named after when, the system, the CPU and the GPU
//! (`2026-10-16_1830_macos-26-3-1_apple-m1-pro.txt`, see
//! [`crate::perf_log::log_name`]), headed with the machine and the commit,
//! with the performance log of the run beside it (`.perf.log`); so runs on
//! several machines can be kept side by side, committed and compared.
//! Stopping it (Esc, which also prints the table so far, closing the window,
//! or Ctrl+C in the terminal) keeps the laps measured. The settings tried
//! are never saved.
